Introduction
Debugging is like finding a needle in a haystack 🧐. It takes years to master, just like pretending to understand "Inception." This guide is your debugging compass 🧭, especially for school shenanigans.

Debugging Tips
Simulate It Like You Mean It: Use Docker to make your code dance to the checker's beats. 💃
Ask Your Code Some Questions: Is the web server on a coffee break ☕? What port is it moonwalking on? 🌙
Check Logs, Not Your Crush's Instagram: Logs live in /var/log, and tail -f is your backstage pass. 🎤
Quick Machine Checkup
See If It's Alive: Use w to check if the server's uptime is a marathon or a nap.
Spy on Command History: Because sometimes, even servers have a "what did I do last night" moment. 🤔
Top Secret: Use top to know who's the CPU ninja, and df to see if your disk is on a diet. 🍩
Debugging Wisdom
Debugging is like playing hide and seek with bugs 🐜. It's frustrating but a rite of passage. Bugs never retire, and the more experienced you get, the sneakier they become. Good luck, debugging jedi! 🚀✨

Load Balancer Shenanigans
Ever wondered how web giants handle traffic? Not with one server, but with a load balancer juggling tens of thousands! It's like spinning plates, but with servers. 😅🔄
