**Web Stack Outage Postmortem: The Epic Saga of Server Shenanigans**

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: March 8, 2024, 15:00 UTC
  - End Time: March 9, 2024, 01:00 UTC
- **Impact:** 
  - Brace yourselves for a rollercoaster ride of web woes! Our beloved web application took an unexpected siesta, leaving users hanging with intermittent slowdowns and ultimately going completely AWOL, affecting a staggering 80% of our cherished users. ðŸ˜±
- **Root Cause:** 
  - Hold onto your hats, folks! It seems our database had a wild hair up its SQL, chewing through resources like a kid in a candy store due to a query that was as unruly as a rodeo bull.

**Timeline:**

- **Detection Time:** 
  - March 8, 2024, 15:30 UTC
- **Detection Method:** 
  - Our trusty monitoring system, the ever-vigilant watchdog, started barking frantically, alerting us to the impending catastrophe.
- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Armed with our virtual Sherlock hats and magnifying glasses, we dove headfirst into server logs and database metrics, ready to uncover the miscreant behind the madness.
  - Rumor has it, we briefly considered blaming gremlins or a mischievous leprechaun, but alas, it was just a pesky database query playing tricks on us.
- **Misleading Paths:** 
  - Picture this: a room full of engineers scratching their heads, contemplating blaming aliens or a cosmic glitch for the sudden spike in server load. Hey, we've seen stranger things!
- **Escalation:** 
  - With no extraterrestrial culprits in sight, we rallied the troopsâ€”cue the dramatic musicâ€”as our database and infrastructure teams joined forces to tackle the rogue query head-on.
- **Resolution:** 
  - After an epic battle of wits and code, we emerged victorious, taming the unruly query and optimizing it to play nice with our server resources once again. Victory dance ensued! ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause Explanation:** 
  - Buckle up, because here's the scoop: our database query was hogging resources like it was its last meal at an all-you-can-eat buffet.
- **Resolution Explanation:** 
  - With a few clever tweaks and optimizations, we whipped that query into shape, teaching it some manners and restoring order to our server kingdom.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Say goodbye to rogue queries! We've instituted a "query manners" training program to ensure all database queries behave themselves in the future.
  - Our enhanced monitoring systems now keep a vigilant eye on server resources, ready to sound the alarm at the slightest hint of misbehavior.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - It's optimization time! We're optimizing all database queries to prevent future resource hogging incidents and keep our servers happy.
  - Say hello to caching mechanisms! We're implementing caching to lighten the load on our precious server resources and keep things running smoothly.
  - We're conducting a thorough review of our server infrastructure, sniffing out any potential bottlenecks or troublemakers lurking in the shadows.
